You will need to write a Java program that runs from the command line.

Your program should prompt the user for input using the Scanner class in Java.

Your program should have a menu of options for the user to choose from. For example, you might include options to calculate a sum, calculate an average, or display a list of numbers.

Your program should use control structures like if-else statements or switch statements to handle the user's input and execute the corresponding action.

Your program should handle invalid input gracefully, such as by displaying an error message and allowing the user to try again.

Your program should include comments to explain what each part of the code does.

Test your program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.
